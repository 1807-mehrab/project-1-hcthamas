To utilize this application, you must set the username and password in the ConnectionUtil.java file with
the credentials of the database you created to house this project. It is hosted on the local machine and
you may need to configure/setup approriately.

The "project1.sql" file will configure the database with the values used to run the base version of the
project. This will differ from the project present as test data was uploading since the initialization.
One thing to note: any process that uploads/edits data to the database will return you to the "main.htlm"
page.

This project was built using Spring Tools Suit, Apache Tomcat 8.5, using a Maven build.
